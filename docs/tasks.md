# LuckyPets Logistics System Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of improvement tasks for the LuckyPets Logistics System. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Critical Issues

- [X] Create a common event interface or abstract class for all event types
- [ ] Implement event versioning strategy for backward compatibility
- [ ] Add API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- [ ] Implement proper service discovery and configuration management
- [ ] Implement asynchronous event handling in ShipmentScannedListener (currently using synchronous .get())
- [X] Extract hardcoded status values ("In Transit", "Delivered") to enum or constants

- [ ] Add equals() and hashCode() methods to entity and event classes
- [ ] Add validation annotations (@NotNull, @Size, etc.) to entity and event classes
- [ ] Implement pagination for list endpoints to handle large datasets
- [ ] Add version field to entities for optimistic locking
- [ ] Use DTOs instead of exposing entities directly in controllers
- [ ] Add consistent error response format across all services
